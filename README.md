## Overview

Kernel provides containerized, ready-to-use Chrome browser environments for agentic workflows that need to access the Internet. `containers/docker/Dockerfile` and `unikernels/unikraft-cu` are the core infra that powers our [hosted services](https://onkernel.com).

### Key Features

- Pre-configured Chrome browser that Chrome DevTools-based browser frameworks (Playwright, Puppeteer) can connect to
- GUI access for visual monitoring and remote control
- Anthropic's [Computer Use](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-quickstarts/tree/main/computer-use-demo) agent loop & chat interface baked in

### What You Can Do With It

- Run automated browser-based workflows
- Develop and test AI agents that use browsers
- Build custom tools that require controlled browser environments

`containers/docker` and `unikernels/unikraft-cu` functionally do the same thing:
1. Pull from Anthropic's Computer Use reference implementation
2. Install Chromium
3. Expose ports so Chrome DevTools-based frameworks (Playwright, Puppeteer) can connect to the instance
4. Expose a remote GUI through noVNC

The unikernel implementation works the same as the Docker-only image but has the additional benefits of running on a unikernel: 
- Automated standby / "sleep mode" when there isn't any network activity (consuming negligible resources when it does)
- When it goes into standby mode, the unikernelâ€™s state gets snapshotted and can be restored exactly as it was when it went to sleep. This could be useful if you want to reuse a sessionâ€™s state (browser auth cookies, interact with local files, browser settings, even the exact page and window zoom you were on).
- Extremely fast cold restarts (<20ms), which could be useful for any application that requires super low latency event handlers.
